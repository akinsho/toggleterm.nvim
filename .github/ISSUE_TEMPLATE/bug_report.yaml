        Please search to see if an issue already exists for the bug you encountered.
        Do not open an issue using just a premade configuration, the most productive
        way to debug an issue is using a minimal init.lua that does nothing other than
        load this plugin and do the few other steps required to reproduce the issue.

        Please note if you have not tested your issue with a minimal configuration I will close
        it. Many problems are caused by misconfiguration and interactions this takes up a lot of
        my time to narrow down. Please always use a minimal config when reporting bugs.
