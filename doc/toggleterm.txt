REQUIREMENTS                                         *toggleterm-requirements*

This plugin only works in _Neovim 0.7_ or newer.

INSTALLATION                                         *toggleterm-installation*

Using packer in lua

>
    use {"akinsho/toggleterm.nvim", tag = '*', config = function()
      require("toggleterm").setup()
    end}
<


Using vim-plug in vimscript

>
    Plug 'akinsho/toggleterm.nvim', {'tag' : '*'}
<


You can/should specify a tag for the current major version of the plugin, to
avoid breaking changes as this plugin evolves. To use a version of this plugin
compatible with nvim versions less than 0.7 please use the tag `v1.*`.

NOTICES                                                   *toggleterm-notices*


- **28/07/1990** — If using `persist_mode` terminal mappings should be changed to use `wincmd` instead otherwise persist mode will not work correctly. See |toggleterm-here| for details.


WHY?                                                         *toggleterm-why?*

Neovim’s terminal is a very cool, but not super ergonomic tool to use. I find
that I often want to set a process going and leave it to continue to run in the
background. I don’t need to see it all the time. I just need to be able to
refer back to it at intervals. I also sometimes want to create a new terminal
and run a few commands.

Sometimes I want these side by side, and I _really_ want these terminals to be
easy to access. I also want my terminal to look different from non-terminal
buffers, so I use `winhighlight` to darken them based on the `Normal`
background colour.

This is the exact use case this was designed for. If that’s your use case
this might work for you.

ROADMAP                                                   *toggleterm-roadmap*

All I really want this plugin to be is what I described above. A wrapper around
the terminal functionality.

It basically (almost) does all that I need it to.

I won’t be turning this into a REPL plugin or doing a bunch of complex stuff.
If you find any issues, _please_ consider a _pull request_ not an issue. I’m
also going to be pretty conservative about what I add.

SETUP ~

This plugin must be explicitly enabled by using `require("toggleterm").setup{}`

Setting the `open_mapping` key to use for toggling the terminal(s) will set up
mappings for _normal_ mode If you prefix the mapping with a number that
particular terminal will be opened.

If you set the `insert_mappings` key to true, the mapping will also take effect
in insert mode; similarly setting `terminal_mappings` to will have the mappings
take effect in the opened terminal.

However you will not be able to use a count with the open mapping in terminal
and insert modes. You can create buffer specific mappings to exit terminal mode
and then use a count with the open mapping. Check _Terminal window mappings_
for an example of how to do this.

alternatively you can do this manually (not recommended but, your prerogative)

>
    " set
    autocmd TermEnter term://*toggleterm#*
          \ tnoremap <silent><c-t> <Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
    
    " By applying the mappings this way you can pass a count to your
    " mapping to open a specific window.
    " For example: 2<C-t> will open terminal 2
    nnoremap <silent><c-t> <Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
    inoremap <silent><c-t> <Esc><Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
<


**NOTE**: Please ensure you have set `hidden` in your neovim config, otherwise
the terminals will be discarded when closed.

**WARNING**: Please do not copy and paste this configuration! It is here to
show what options are available. It is not written to be used as is.

USAGE ~

`TOGGLETERM` ~

This is the command the mappings call under the hood. You can use it directly
and prefix it with a count to target a specific terminal. This function also
takes arguments `size`, `dir` and `direction`. e.g.

>
    :ToggleTerm size=40 dir=~/Desktop direction=horizontal
<


If `dir` is specified on creation toggle term will open at the specified
directory. If the terminal has already been opened at a particular directory it
will remain in that directory.

The directory can also be specified as `git_dir` which toggleterm will then use
to try and derive the git repo directory. _NOTE_: This will not work for
`git-worktrees` or other more complex setups.

If `size` is specified, and the command opens a split (horizontal/vertical)
terminal, the height/width of all terminals in the same direction will be
changed to `size`.

If `direction` is specified, and the command opens a terminal, the terminal
will be changed to the specified direction.

`size` and `direction` are ignored if the command closes a terminal.

                                                          *toggleterm-Caveats*


- Having multiple terminals with different directions open at the same time is unsupported.


`TOGGLETERMTOGGLEALL` ~

This command allows you to open all the previously toggled terminal in one go
or close all the open terminals at once.

`TERMEXEC` ~

This command allows you to open a terminal with a specific action.
e.g. `2TermExec cmd="git status" dir=~/<my-repo-path>` will run git status in
terminal 2. note that the `cmd` argument **must be quoted**.

_NOTE:_ the `dir` argument can also be _optionally_ quoted if it contains
spaces.

The `cmd` and `dir` arguments can also expand the same special keywords as `:h
expand` e.g. `TermExec cmd="echo %"` will be expanded to `TermExec cmd="echo
/file/example"`

These special keywords can be escaped using the `\` character, if you want to
print character as is.

The `size` and `direction` arguments are like the `size` and `direction`
arguments of `ToggleTerm`.

By default, focus is returned to the original window after executing the
command (except for floating terminals). Use argument `go_back=0` to disable
this behaviour.

You can send commands to a terminal without opening its window by using the
`open=0` argument.

see `:h expand()` for more details

SENDING LINES TO THE TERMINAL ~

You can "send lines" to the toggled terminals with the following commands:


- `:ToggleTermSendCurrentLine <T_ID>`: sends the whole line where you are standing with your cursor
- `:ToggleTermSendVisualLines <T_ID>`: sends all the (whole) lines in your visual selection
- `:ToggleTermSendVisualSelection <T_ID>`: sends only the visually selected text (this can be a block of text or a selection in a single line)


(`<T_ID` is an optional terminal ID parameter, which defines where should we
send the lines. If the parameter is not provided, then the default is the
`first terminal`)

TOGGLETERMSETNAME ~

This function allows setting a display name for a terminal. This name is
primarily used inside the winbar, and can be a more descriptive way to
remember, which terminal is for what.

You can map this to a key and call it with a count, which will then prompt you
a name for the terminal with the matching ID. Alternatively you can call it
with just the name e.g. `:ToggleTermSetName work<CR>` this will the prompt you
for which terminal it should apply to. Lastly you can call it without any
arguments, and it will prompt you for which terminal it should apply to then
prompt you for the name to use.

SET TERMINAL SHADING ~

This plugin automatically shades terminal filetypes to be darker than other
window you can disable this by setting `shade_terminals = false` in the setup
object

>
    require'toggleterm'.setup {
      shade_terminals = false
    }
<


alternatively you can set, _which_ filetypes should be shaded by setting

>
    -- fzf is just an example
    require'toggleterm'.setup {
      shade_filetypes = { "none", "fzf" }
    }
<


setting `"none"` will allow normal terminal buffers to be highlighted.

SET PERSISTENT SIZE ~

By default, this plugin will persist the size of horizontal and vertical
terminals. Split terminals in the same direction always have the same size. You
can disable this behaviour by setting `persist_size = false` in the setup
object. Disabling this behaviour forces the opening terminal size to the `size`
defined in the setup object.

>
    require'toggleterm'.setup{
      persist_size = false
    }
<


TERMINAL WINDOW MAPPINGS ~

It can be helpful to add mappings to make moving in and out of a terminal
easier once toggled, whilst still keeping it open.

>
    function _G.set_terminal_keymaps()
      local opts = {buffer = 0}
      vim.keymap.set('t', '<esc>', [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)
      vim.keymap.set('t', 'jk', [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)
      vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-h>', [[<Cmd>wincmd h<CR>]], opts)
      vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-j>', [[<Cmd>wincmd j<CR>]], opts)
      vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-k>', [[<Cmd>wincmd k<CR>]], opts)
      vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-l>', [[<Cmd>wincmd l<CR>]], opts)
    end
    
    -- if you only want these mappings for toggle term use term://*toggleterm#* instead
    vim.cmd('autocmd! TermOpen term://* lua set_terminal_keymaps()')
<


CUSTOM TERMINALS ~

title=''/> _using lazygit <https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit>_

Toggleterm also exposes the `Terminal` class so that this can be used to create
custom terminals for showing terminal UIs like `lazygit`, `htop` etc.

Each terminal can take the following arguments:

>
    Terminal:new {
      cmd = string -- command to execute when creating the terminal e.g. 'top'
      direction = string -- the layout for the terminal, same as the main config options
      dir = string -- the directory for the terminal
      close_on_exit = bool -- close the terminal window when the process exits
      highlights = table -- a table with highlights
      env = table -- key:value table with environmental variables passed to jobstart()
      clear_env = bool -- use only environmental variables from `env`, passed to jobstart()
      on_open = fun(t: Terminal) -- function to run when the terminal opens
      on_close = fun(t: Terminal) -- function to run when the terminal closes
      auto_scroll = boolean -- automatically scroll to the bottom on terminal output
      -- callbacks for processing the output
      on_stdout = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, data: string[], name: string) -- callback for processing output on stdout
      on_stderr = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, data: string[], name: string) -- callback for processing output on stderr
      on_exit = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, exit_code: number, name: string) -- function to run when terminal process exits
    }
<


                                            *toggleterm-Custom-terminal-usage*

>
    local Terminal  = require('toggleterm.terminal').Terminal
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({ cmd = "lazygit", hidden = true })
    
    function _lazygit_toggle()
      lazygit:toggle()
    end
    
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>g", "<cmd>lua _lazygit_toggle()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
<


Custom terminal usage                  This will create a new terminal, but the
                                       specified command is not being run
                                       immediately. The command will run once
                                       the terminal is opened. Alternatively
                                       `term:spawn()` can be used to start the
                                       command in a background buffer without
                                       opening a terminal window yet. If the
                                       `hidden` key is set to true, this
                                       terminal will not be toggled by normal
                                       toggleterm commands such as
                                       `:ToggleTerm` or the open mapping. It
                                       will only open and close by using the
                                       returned terminal object. A mapping for
                                       toggling the terminal can be set as in
                                       the example above.


Alternatively the terminal can be specified with a count, which is the number
that can be used to trigger this specific terminal. This can then be triggered
using the current count e.g. `:5ToggleTerm<CR>`

>
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({ cmd = "lazygit", count = 5 })
<


You can also set a custom layout for a terminal.

>
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({
      cmd = "lazygit",
      dir = "git_dir",
      direction = "float",
      float_opts = {
        border = "double",
      },
      -- function to run on opening the terminal
      on_open = function(term)
        vim.cmd("startinsert!")
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(term.bufnr, "n", "q", "<cmd>close<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
      end,
      -- function to run on closing the terminal
      on_close = function(term)
        vim.cmd("startinsert!")
      end,
    })
    
    function _lazygit_toggle()
      lazygit:toggle()
    end
    
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>g", "<cmd>lua _lazygit_toggle()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
<


**WARNING**: do not use any of the private functionality of the terminal or
other non-public parts of the API as these can change in the future.

STATUSLINE ~

To tell each terminal apart you can use the terminal buffer variable
`b:toggle_number` in your statusline

>
    " this is pseudo code
    let statusline .= '%{&ft == "toggleterm" ? "terminal (".b:toggle_number.")" : ""}'
<


CUSTOM COMMANDS ~

You can create your on commands by using the lua functions this plugin provides
directly

>
    command! -count=1 TermGitPush  lua require'toggleterm'.exec("git push",    <count>, 12)
    command! -count=1 TermGitPushF lua require'toggleterm'.exec("git push -f", <count>, 12)
<


OPEN MULTIPLE TERMINALS SIDE-BY-SIDE ~

│Direction │Supported│
│vertical  │✔️   │
│horizontal│✔️   │
│tab       │✖️   │
│float     │✖️   │


In your first terminal, you need to leave the `TERMINAL` mode using C-\C-N
which can be remapped to Esc for ease of use. <img
src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31947091/133395516-22fef1e6-633d-4964-9175-f76fabf66794.png'
title=''/>

Then you type on: `2<C-\>`, and the result: <img
src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31947091/133396789-fdf68b30-3a8c-440b-822f-6549f282c4fc.png'
title=''/>

Explain:


- `2`: this is the terminal’s number (or ID), your first terminal is `1` (e.g. your 3rd terminal will be `3<C-\>`, so on).
- C-\: this is the combined key mapping to the command `:ToggleTerm`.
