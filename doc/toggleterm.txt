WHY?                                                         *toggleterm-why?*

Neovim’s terminal is a very cool, but not super ergonomic tool to use. I find
that I often want to set a process going and leave it to continue to run in the
background. I don’t need to see it all the time. I just need to be able to
refer back to it at intervals. I also sometimes want to create a new terminal
and run a few commands.

Sometimes I want these side by side, and I _really_ want these terminals to be
easy to access and not clutter my buffer list. I also want my terminal to look
different from non-terminal buffers so I use `winhighlight` to darken them
based on the `Normal` background colour.

This is the exact use case this was designed for. If that’s your use case
this might work for you.

ROADMAP                                                   *toggleterm-roadmap*

All I really want this plugin to be is what I described above. A wrapper around
the terminal functionality.

It basically (almost) does all that I need it to.

I won’t be turning this into a REPL plugin or doing a bunch of complex stuff.
If you find any issues, _please_ consider a _pull request_ not an issue. I
won’t be breaking my back to maintain this especially if it isn’t broken
"on my machine". I’m also going to be pretty conservative about what I add.

SETUP ~

This plugin must be explicitly enabled by using `require("toggleterm").setup{}`

Setting the _open_mapping_ key to use for toggling the terminal(s) will setup
mappings for _normal_ mode If you prefix the mapping with a number that
particular terminal will be opened.

If you set the _insert_mappings_ key to true, the mapping will also take effect
in insert mode; similarly setting _terminal_mappings_ to will have the mappings
take effect in the opened terminal.

However you will not be able to use a count with the open mapping in terminal
and insert modes. You can create buffer specific mappings to exit terminal mode
and then use a count with the open mapping. Check _Terminal window mappings_
for an example of how to do this.

**NOTE**: Please ensure you have set `hidden` in your neovim config, otherwise
the terminals will be discarded when closed.

alternatively you can do this manually (not recommended but, your prerogative)

    " or manually...

          \ tnoremap <silent><c-t> <Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
    
    " By applying the mappings this way you can pass a count to your
    " mapping to open a specific window.
    " For example: 2<C-t> will open terminal 2
    nnoremap <silent><c-t> <Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
    inoremap <silent><c-t> <Esc><Cmd>exe v:count1 . "ToggleTerm"<CR>
<


USAGE ~

This plugin provides 2 commands

`TOGGLETERM` ~

This is the command the mappings call under the hood. You can use it directly
and prefix it with a count to target a specific terminal. This function also
takes arguments `size`, `dir` and `direction`. e.g.

>
    :ToggleTerm size=40 dir=~/Desktop direction=horizontal
<


If `dir` is specified on creation toggle term will open at the specified
directory. If the terminal has already been opened at a particular directory it
will remain in that directory.

The directory can also be specified as `git_dir` which toggleterm will then use
to try and derive the git repo directory. _NOTE_: This currently will not work
for `git-worktrees` or other more complex setups.

If `size` is specified and the command opens a split (horizontal/vertical)
terminal, the height/width of all terminals in the same direction will be
changed to `size`.

If `direction` is specified and the command opens a terminal, the terminal will
be changed to the specified direction.

`size` and `direction` are ignored if the command closes a terminal.

                                                          *toggleterm-Caveats*


- Having multiple terminals with different directions open at the same time is currently unsupported.


`TOGGLETERMTOGGLEALL` ~

This command allows you to open all the previously toggled terminal in one go
or close all the currently open terminals at once.

`TERMEXEC` ~

This command allows you to open a terminal with a specific action.
e.g. `2TermExec cmd="git status" dir=~/<my-repo-path>` will run git status in
terminal 2. note that the `cmd` argument **must be quoted**.

_NOTE:_ the `dir` argument can also be _optionally_ quoted if it contains
spaces.

The `cmd` and `dir` arguments can also expand the same special keywords as `:h
expand` e.g. `TermExec cmd="echo %"` will be expanded to `TermExec cmd="echo
/file/example"`

The `size` and `direction` arguments are like the `size` and `direction`
arguments of `ToggleTerm`.

By default focus is returned to the original window after executing the command
(except for floating terminals). Use argument `go_back=0` to disable this
behaviour.

You can send commands to a terminal without opening its window by using the
`open=0` argument.

see `:h expand()` for more details

SET TERMINAL SHADING ~

This plugin automatically shades terminal filetypes to be darker than other
window you can disable this by setting `shade_terminals = false` in the setup
object

>
    require'toggleterm'.setup {
      shade_terminals = false
    }
<


alternatively you can set _which_ filetypes should be shaded by setting

>
    -- fzf is just an example
    require'toggleterm'.setup {
      shade_filetypes = { "none", "fzf" }
    }
<


setting `"none"` will allow normal terminal buffers to be highlighted.

SET PERSISTENT SIZE ~

By default, this plugin will persist the size of horizontal and vertical
terminals. Split terminals in the same direction always have the same size. You
can disable this behaviour by setting `persist_size = false` in the setup
object. Disabling this behaviour forces the opening terminal size to the `size`
defined in the setup object.

>
    require'toggleterm'.setup{
      persist_size = false
    }
<


TERMINAL WINDOW MAPPINGS ~

It can be helpful to add mappings to make moving in and out of a terminal
easier once toggled, whilst still keeping it open.

>
    function _G.set_terminal_keymaps()
      local opts = {noremap = true}
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 't', '<esc>', [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 't', 'jk', [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 't', '<C-h>', [[<C-\><C-n><C-W>h]], opts)

      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 't', '<C-k>', [[<C-\><C-n><C-W>k]], opts)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 't', '<C-l>', [[<C-\><C-n><C-W>l]], opts)
    end
    
    -- if you only want these mappings for toggle term use term://*toggleterm#* instead
    vim.cmd('autocmd! TermOpen term://* lua set_terminal_keymaps()')

CUSTOM TERMINALS ~

title=''/> _using lazygit <https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit>_

Toggleterm also exposes the `Terminal` class so that this can be used to create
custom terminals for showing terminal UIs like `lazygit`, `htop` etc.

Each terminal can take the following arguments:

>
    Terminal:new {
      cmd = string -- command to execute when creating the terminal e.g. 'top'
      direction = string -- the layout for the terminal, same as the main config options
      dir = string -- the directory for the terminal
      close_on_exit = bool -- close the terminal window when the process exits
      on_open = fun(t: Terminal) -- function to run when the terminal opens
      on_close = fun(t: Terminal) -- function to run when the terminal closes
      -- callbacks for processing the output
      on_stdout = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, data: string[], name: string) -- callback for processing output on stdout
      on_stderr = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, data: string[], name: string) -- callback for processing output on stderr
      on_exit = fun(t: Terminal, job: number, exit_code: number, name: string) -- function to run when terminal process exits
    }
<


                                                            *toggleterm-Usage*

>
    local Terminal  = require('toggleterm.terminal').Terminal
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({ cmd = "lazygit", hidden = true })
    
    function _lazygit_toggle()
      lazygit:toggle()
    end
    
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>g", "<cmd>lua _lazygit_toggle()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
<


Usage                                  This will create a new terminal that
                                       runs the specified command once toggled
                                       if the `hidden` key is set to true. This
                                       terminal will not be toggled by normal
                                       toggleterm commands such as
                                       `:ToggleTerm` or the open mapping. It
                                       will only open and close in response to
                                       a user specified mapping like the above.


Alternatively the terminal can be specified with a count which is the number
that can be used to trigger this specific terminal. This can then be triggered
using the current count e.g. `:5ToggleTerm<CR>`

>
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({ cmd = "lazygit", count = 5 })
<


You can also set a custom layout for a terminal.

>
    local lazygit = Terminal:new({
      cmd = "lazygit",
      dir = "git_dir",
      direction = "float",
      float_opts = {
        border = "double",
      },
      -- function to run on opening the terminal
      on_open = function(term)
        vim.cmd("startinsert!")
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(term.bufnr, "n", "q", "<cmd>close<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
      end,
      -- function to run on closing the terminal
      on_close = function(term)
        vim.cmd("Closing terminal")
      end,
    })
    
    function _lazygit_toggle()
      lazygit:toggle()
    end
    
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader>g", "<cmd>lua _lazygit_toggle()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
<


**WARNING**: do not use any of the private functionality of the terminal or
other non-public parts of the API as these can change in the future.

STATUSLINE ~

In order to tell each terminal apart you can use the terminal buffer variable
`b:toggle_number` in your statusline

>
    " this is pseudo code
    let statusline .= '%{&ft == "toggleterm" ? "terminal (".b:toggle_number.")" : ""}'
<


CUSTOM COMMANDS ~

You can create your on commands by using the lua functions this plugin provides
directly

>
    command! -count=1 TermGitPush  lua require'toggleterm'.exec("git push",    <count>, 12)
    command! -count=1 TermGitPushF lua require'toggleterm'.exec("git push -f", <count>, 12)
<


OPEN MULTIPLE TERMINALS SIDE-BY-SIDE ~

│Direction │Supported│
│vertical  │✔️   │
│horizontal│✔️   │
│window    │✖️   │
│float     │✖️   │


In your first terminal, you need to leave the `TERMINAL` mode using C-\C-N
which can be remapped to Esc for ease of use. <img
src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31947091/133395516-22fef1e6-633d-4964-9175-f76fabf66794.png'
title=''/>

Then you type on: `2<C-\>`, and the result: <img
src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31947091/133396789-fdf68b30-3a8c-440b-822f-6549f282c4fc.png'
title=''/>

Explain:


- `2`: this is the terminal’s number (or ID), your first terminal is `1` (e.g. your 3rd terminal will be `3<C-\>`, so on).
- C-\: this is the combined key mapping to the command `:ToggleTerm`.
